# My Language Learning Path

Welcome to the section of my repository dedicated to my programming language journey. This is where I document my progress, share my code, and reflect on my learning.

## My Journey So Far

I began my programming journey with **Python**, which provided a solid foundation in programming logic and syntax. From there, I expanded my knowledge to include a variety of other languages, each chosen for a specific purpose:

*   **C:** To understand low-level memory management and high-performance computing.
*   **Go:** For its efficiency in building concurrent systems and command-line tools.
*   **Lua:** For its lightweight and embeddable nature, making it ideal for scripting in larger applications.
*   **Bash:** As an essential tool for shell scripting and automating tasks in a Linux environment.

I am continuously developing my skills in these languages, with a particular interest in those that are low-level, high-efficiency, and fast. My language choices are driven by two main passions: the need to **automate** (with Bash, Go, and Lua) and the desire to **create** reliable and performant software (with C/C++, and in the future, Rust).

## A Note on AI

I want to be transparent about my use of AI in this repository.

**I do not use any form of AI to *write* the code you see here.**

However, I am a firm believer in using AI as a powerful learning tool. I frequently use it to:

*   Understand complex concepts.
*   Get feedback on my code.
*   Explore new ideas and approaches.

All the code in this repository is written by me, whether it's inspired by other developers, part of a course or bootcamp, or an original creation. The primary goal of this section is to document and showcase my ongoing programming journey.
