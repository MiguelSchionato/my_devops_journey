# My Journey: Cultivating DevOps & System Administration Expertise

Welcome to my personal GitHub space, a dynamic reflection of my journey and passion for DevOps, Linux System Administration, and Backend Development. Here, I document my hands-on learning, share personal projects, and showcase the tools and philosophies that drive my pursuit of efficient and automated technical solutions.

My core philosophy revolves around minimalism, speed, and a lightweight workflow. This preference for lean and efficient systems directly aligns with DevOps principles of optimization, automation, and continuous improvement. I believe that understanding the fundamentals and automating repetitive tasks are key to building resilient and scalable infrastructures.
#### What You'll Find Here (all under development)
This repository is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of my technical journey:

- Server-configs: A detailed log of my home server setup, running on Arch Linux. This includes initial system configurations, robust network setups (leveraging DHCP reservations for stable IP management), and essential security hardening. This section highlights my practical experience in building and maintaining foundational infrastructure.
- Programming-languages: My ongoing journey into programming, with a current focus on Python. Here, you'll find learning exercises, scripts, and small projects that demonstrate my grasp of coding fundamentals and my ability to develop automation tools â€“ a critical skill for any DevOps or backend role.
- Learning-notes: A collection of concise notes, summaries, and deeper dives into various technical concepts, tools, and best practices. These notes, synchronized from my Obsidian vault, cover topics in system administration, networking, software development, and core DevOps methodologies.
-  Development Environment: My daily workstation runs Arch Linux with Hyprland. This choice reflects my strong preference for a fast, lightweight, and highly customizable environment, allowing me to fine-tune every aspect of my workflow for maximum efficiency and productivity.

#### My Goals & Professional Aspirations

I am actively pursuing a career as a DevOps Engineer junior or System Administrator junior. My goal is to contribute to teams that value automation, continuous delivery, and robust infrastructure management. I am keen on applying my growing skills in:

- Linux System Administration: Deep understanding of Linux environments, troubleshooting, and optimization.
- Automation & Scripting: intermediate knowledge in scripting languages (especially Python and bash) for automating tasks and building custom tools.
- Containerization: Learning how to work with technologies like Docker for consistent and isolated application deployment.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Documenting and managing infrastructure through code (e.g., Ansible).
- Monitoring & Observability: Setting up systems to gain insights into application and infrastructure health.
I am **open to remote job opportunities** that allow me to grow my expertise, collaborate with talented individuals, and apply my passion for building efficient and reliable systems.
