# My Journey: Cultivating DevOps & System Administration Expertise

Welcome to my personal GitHub space, a dynamic reflection of my journey and passion for DevOps, Linux System Administration, and Backend Development. Here, I document my hands-on learning, share personal projects, and showcase the tools and philosophies that drive my pursuit of efficient and automated technical solutions.

My core philosophy revolves around minimalism, speed, and a lightweight workflow. This preference for lean and efficient systems directly aligns with DevOps principles of optimization, automation, and continuous improvement. I believe that understanding the fundamentals and automating repetitive tasks are key to building resilient and scalable infrastructures.

## What You'll Find Here 
This repository is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of my technical journey:

- [Home_server](my_devops_journey/Home_server/README.md): A detailed log of my home server setup, running on Arch Linux. Demonstrates practical experience in system administration, network configuration, and security hardening on a bare-metal Arch Linux server. It showcases my ability to build and maintain foundational infrastructure from the ground up. 
	- This includes initial system configurations, robust network setups (leveraging DHCP reservations for stable IP management), and essential security hardening.
- [Programming-languages](my_devops_journey/Languages/README.md): My ongoing journey into programming, with a current focus on Shell Script, GO and Python. Here, you'll find learning exercises, scripts, and small projects that demonstrate my grasp of coding fundamentals and my ability to develop automation tools ‚Äì a critical skill for any DevOps or SysAdmin role.
- [Learning-notes](my_devops_journey/Learning%20journey/README.md): A collection of concise notes, summaries, and deeper dives into various technical concepts, tools, and best practices. These notes, synchronized from my Obsidian vault, cover topics in system administration, networking, software development, and core DevOps methodologies.
-  [Development Environment](https://github.com/MiguelSchionato/my_dotfiles):  A look into my daily driver setup (Arch Linux + Hyprland), which reflects my passion for creating a fast, lightweight, and highly customized workflow optimized for productivity.

#### My Goals & Professional Aspirations

I am actively pursuing a career as a **DevOps Engineer junior** or **System Administrator junior**. My goal is to contribute to teams that value automation, continuous delivery, and robust infrastructure management. I am keen on applying my growing skills in:

- Linux System Administration: Deep understanding of Linux environments, troubleshooting, and optimization.
- Automation & Scripting:  Developing proficiency in scripting languages (especially Python and bash) for automating tasks and building custom tools.
- Containerization: Developing proficiency in containerization with Docker to create consistent and isolated application environments
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Actively learning IaC principles with Ansible to provision and manage infrastructure declaratively. 
- Monitoring & Observability: Exploring monitoring stacks (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) to ensure application and infrastructure health. 

I am **open to remote job opportunities** that allow me to grow my expertise, collaborate with talented individuals, and apply my passion for building efficient and reliable systems.
