# Bubble Sort
It's a basic (and rather inefficient) type of sort, used mostly because of their intuitive and educative purpose.

It consists in look up two number in a sequence in an array and check which one is bigger and swap it, to either a crescent or decrescent order. It is inefficient because it takes O(n2) at worst case scenario, because it have to look each order n times and look it again.
