# Data Structures and Algorithms

In this chapter of my journey, I am diving deep into the foundational concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal is to move beyond language-specific syntax and build a robust, language-agnostic understanding of how to design and analyze efficient, scalable code. This theoretical foundation is critical for tackling complex problems in software engineering and system design.

## 🎯 Philosophy and Approach

My approach to learning DSA is grounded in the belief that true understanding comes from a combination of theory, implementation, and practical application.

1.  **Theory-First:** I will start by studying the conceptual underpinnings of each data structure and algorithm—how it works, its performance characteristics (Big O notation), and its trade-offs.
2.  **Implementation from Scratch:** After understanding the theory, I will implement each structure and algorithm from scratch. This hands-on coding reinforces the concepts and exposes the practical details that theory can obscure. The code will be written in various languages (like C, Go, and Python) to appreciate different low-level and high-level implementations.
3.  **Problem-Solving Practice:** Finally, I will solve targeted problems on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank. This step is crucial for learning to identify which DSA is the right tool for a given problem.

## 📂 Project Structure & Code Source

The code in this directory is organized into small, focused modules, with each file or sub-directory dedicated to a single data structure or algorithm.

These are not meant to be standalone projects. Rather, they are my personal "etudes" or "katas" —small, deliberate practice exercises designed to build mastery, much like a musician practices scales and arpeggios. They serve as my reference implementations and a living document of my progress.

### Disclaimer
Much of the work here will be guided by textbooks, courses, and online resources. While I will always attempt to write the code myself and solve problems on my own first, the primary goal is to **learn**. I will document my thought process, credit my sources, and rewrite solutions in my own "words" to solidify my understanding.
